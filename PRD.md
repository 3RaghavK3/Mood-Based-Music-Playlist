## Objective

The goal of this project is to develop a mood-based song generation application that selects and plays songs according to a user's chosen mood. The application supports five predefined moods. For each selected mood, it fetches relevant songs using the Deezer API and plays the resulting tracks. The aim is to provide users with a simple, mood-aligned listening experience.
